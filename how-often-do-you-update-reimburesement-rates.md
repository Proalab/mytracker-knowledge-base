# How often do you update reimburesement rates?

In MyWay Mileage Tracker, we update reimbursement rates based on each country’s financial year and tax authority guidelines:

* **USA**: Updated when the IRS releases new rates, typically in December, with the new rates effective from the start of the year.
* **Canada**: Rates are updated when the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) publishes new guidelines, usually at the end of December for the upcoming year.
* **European Countries**: Updated whenever individual tax agencies release new reimbursement rates, which vary by country.
* **Australia**: Reimbursement rates are updated at the start of Australia’s financial year, typically in July, based on updates from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
* **New Zealand**: Rates are updated when the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) releases new guidelines, which generally align with the country’s financial year starting in April.

We make sure to keep the app updated with the latest rates, so your mileage tracking is always compliant.
