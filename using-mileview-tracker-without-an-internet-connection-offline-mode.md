# Using MyWay Tracker without an internet connection (Offline Mode)

The app does not require an internet connection for tracking but will require an active and stable connection if you want to check your previous tracked routes on the map or need to build a report.&#x20;

Also, some features like address geocoding will not work when you don't have an internet connection so you might see some coordinates instead of the actual address. Don't worry, the app will sort it automatically as soon as you have your connection back.
