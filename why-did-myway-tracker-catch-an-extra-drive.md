# Why did MyWay Tracker catch an extra drive?

Extra drives can happen for a few simple reasons, and here’s what might be causing it:

## Logged into Multiple Devices

If you’re using the same MyWay account on multiple devices (e.g., an iPhone and iPad, or an iPhone and Android), the app might get confused. Running the tracker on two devices simultaneously can create duplicate or phantom drives.

**Solution:**&#x20;

Log out of one device or delete the app from it. If you need the app on both devices, use a different email to log in on the second device.

## Recently Moved

WiFi base stations retain their old location even after moving to a new address. If you or someone nearby recently relocated, the old base station location could confuse the tracker into thinking a drive occurred when it didn’t. This issue typically resolves in about a week but can take longer.

**Solution:**&#x20;

Speed up the location update by opening Apple Maps or Google Maps while connected to WiFi for a few hours. This helps the base station recalibrate to its new location.

## Improving Drive Detection

If neither of the above applies, there might be a setup issue affecting drive detection. Check out our [Drive Detection Best Practices](drive-detection-best-practices.md) for tips on optimizing your device to avoid extra or missed drives.

At MyWay, we err on the side of caution by recording uncertain drives rather than discarding them to ensure you don’t lose important trips. If you suspect an issue, review the above steps to fine-tune your tracking experience.
