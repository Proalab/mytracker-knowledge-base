# Your privacy and where we store your data

At MileView Mileage Tracker, your privacy is our top priority. We firmly believe that your data belongs to you and should remain accessible only to you.&#x20;

**Where is your data stored?**&#x20;

All your data—like tracked routes, reports, and settings—is securely stored on your device in local storage. It cannot be accessed by other apps unless you explicitly allow it.&#x20;

**Stopping tracking anytime**

We understand there are times when tracking isn’t appropriate (maybe you are a secret agent with “00” designations). That’s why you can pause tracking with just one button press.&#x20;

**Sensitive data when sharing tracks**&#x20;

When sharing reports and tracks, it’s possible to unintentionally share sensitive data like personal addresses or secret locations. To protect yourself and others, always review and clean up the data before sharing. Share only what’s absolutely necessary.&#x20;

We take privacy seriously—we never sell your data or statistics to third parties. Your data safety is and will always remain a core focus for us.
