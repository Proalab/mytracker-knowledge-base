# The route MileView Tracker produced doesn't look correct

If the route looks off, hereâ€™s why and how to address it:

## **How it works**

MileView Tracker primarily uses GPS to track your drives. For the most accurate results, your phone needs a stable connection with GPS satellites. However, in situations like tunnels, underground parking, or covered areas, direct GPS access might not be available. In those cases, the app relies on alternative methods like WiFi signals, mobile networks, or motion data. These methods can help but are less precise and may result in inaccuracies.

## **Improving accuracy**

* **Motion data**: Allowing access to motion data helps the app differentiate between driving and walking, which improves accuracy significantly.
* **Permissions**: The more permissions you grant, the better the app can track your route.

## **Battery saving mode**

To save battery on longer trips, the app requests geolocation data less frequently. This might make your route look slightly choppy on the map, but the total distance recorded will still be accurate.
