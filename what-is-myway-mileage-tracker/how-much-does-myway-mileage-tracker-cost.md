# How much does MyWay Mileage Tracker cost?

New users can start with our free plan, which lets you track up to 40 trips per month at no cost. Your trips are automatically recognized using the rules you set and the smart analytics we provide.&#x20;

Need more than 40 tracks? Start a 7-day free trial of the full version, which includes advanced AI-based recognition. If MyWay Tracker isn’t for you, cancel anytime during the trial and pay nothing. If you decide to stick with it, your subscription will start automatically when the trial ends—available monthly or annually (with a significant discount). You can cancel anytime; even after canceling, you’ll have access until the end of your billing period without further charges.

Why a subscription? Running MyWay Mileage Tracker comes with costs like maintaining infrastructure, paying for third-party services, and ongoing app development. We don’t sell your data—and development is all funded through subscriptions. This allows us to keep improving while offering one of the most affordable and automated mileage tracking tools on the market.
